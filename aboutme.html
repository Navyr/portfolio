<p style=color:#0000b3;> 
I'm currently a senior at Lynbrook High School and I am part of the school JV badminton team. I enjoy playing the violin and have been singing for ten years. I am also an active member of Link Crew club and the Students for Literacy Club at my school. I volunteer at the library in my spare time. </p>

I absolutely adore dogs. I love pasta and noodles but dessert is my favorite meal of the day.
