<h4>Short Bio</h4>

    
<p> 
I'm currently a senior at Lynbrook High School and I am part of the school JV badminton team. I enjoy playing the violin and have been singing for ten years. I am also an active member of Link Crew club and the Students for Literacy Club at my school. I volunteer at the library in my spare time.

<h4>Likes and Dislikes</h4>

I absolutely adore dogs. I love pasta and noodles but dessert is my favorite meal of the day. My favorite TV shows include Friends, Riverdale and Vampire Diaries.
<br>
I dislike heights. I am terrified of roller coasters and snakes.
